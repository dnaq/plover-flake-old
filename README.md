# A flake for Plover with plugin manager support

## Deprecation notice

This repository will be deprecated soon in favour of dnaq/plover-plugin-flake
which will subsequently be renamed and moved to this repository.

This flake was always somewhat of a hack to workaround the lack of
proper nix derivations for plover plugins, and I believe that the new
flake will fix that in a better way.
